This quick-reference guide is not intended to provide many useful example problems or to provide a full treatment of all the covered topics. Instead, I seek to provide an brief overview of 
many mathematical skills typically required in undergraduate statistics courses. If you need to review any of the topics further, please consult your professor, TA, or other written resources.

Some very basic ideas are covered in this text; please do not take this as an assumption about the reader's level of knowledge or ability. I only wanted to start from the very basics to ensure a sense of completeness in the ideas discussed herein. 

Further, while I have proofread this text several times, there may still be minor mistakes or unclear 
phrasing. If you think I could make any minor adjustments to make the text more readable, 
please open a new Issue on the GitHub repository:

I hope this is helpful.
